## Thinking Out Loud
When performing analysis, ALWAYS explain what you are about to do BEFORE doing it.
For every step, briefly narrate your reasoning so the user can follow along:
- "I'm loading the file to inspect the data structure..."
- "Now I'll check data quality before proceeding to analysis..."
- "Running the analysis with default parameters..."
- "The result looks unusual — let me validate the input data..."
This is critical because analysis can take time and the user needs to see progress.
